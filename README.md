## Ce Customization

Customization in Frappe refers to the ability to modify and tailor the behavior, appearance, and functionality of the Frappe framework and its applications to meet specific business requirements. Frappe provides a flexible and extensible platform that allows users to customize various aspects of the system without modifying the core codebase. With customization, users can create new modules, add or modify fields in existing forms, define workflows, and implement custom business logic.

In addition to creating custom applications, Frappe provides tools and utilities to customize existing applications and modules. Users can modify existing DocTypes (document types) to add or remove fields, define custom validations and triggers, and define workflows to automate business processes. The Frappe framework also supports creating custom scripts and reports to extract and manipulate data according to specific requirements.
